# Flat-Note

Flatnote is an application built in React. Its core functions are to fetch data from json-server(a db file that contains an API of all the universities in the world). The application is supposed to handle all the CRUD operations of a REST API.
However I have been able to implement, GET method(to retrive data) and to display the data.
I am having a problem with Add(POST) request handling and Routing is not  yet configured.
I will keep on trying to add the Add(POST method) to the application
